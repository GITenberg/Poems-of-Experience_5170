<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
EMPTY BOWL</h2>
<p class="poetry">I held the golden vessel of my soul<br />
And prayed that God would fill it from on high.<br />
Day after day the importuning cry<br />
Grew stronger&mdash;grew, a heaven-accusing dole<br />
Because no sacred waters laved my bowl.<br />
&lsquo;So full the fountain, Lord, wouldst Thou deny<br />
The little needed for a soul&rsquo;s supply?<br />
I ask but this small portion of Thy whole.&rsquo;<br />
Then from the vast invisible Somewhere,<br />
A voice, as one love-authorised by Him,<br />
Spake, and the tumult of my heart was stilled.<br />
&lsquo;Who wants the waters must the bowl prepare;<br />
Pour out the self, that chokes it to the brim,<br />
But emptied vessels, from the source are filled.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>KEEP
GOING</h2>
<p class="poetry">Is the goal distant, and troubled the road,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the way long?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heavy your load?<br />
Then gird up your courage, and say &lsquo;I am strong,&rsquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep going.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is the work weary, and endless the grind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And petty the pay?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then brace up your mind<br />
And say &lsquo;Something better is coming my way,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep doing.</p>
<p class="poetry">Is the drink bitter life pours in your
cup&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the taste gall?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then smile and look up<br />
And say &lsquo;God is with me whatever befall,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep trusting.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Is the heart heavy with hope long deferred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with prayers that seem vain?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep saying the word&mdash;<br />
And that which you strive for you yet shall attain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep praying.</p>
<h2><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>A
PRAYER</h2>
<p class="poetry">Just as I shape the purport of my thought,<br
/>
Lord of the Universe, shape Thou my lot.<br />
Let each ill thought that in my heart may be,<br />
Mould circumstance and bring ill luck to me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Until I weed the garden of my mind<br />
From all that is unworthy and unkind,<br />
Am I not master of my mind, dear Lord?<br />
Then as I <i>think</i>, so must be my reward.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who sows in weakness, cannot reap in
strength,<br />
That which we plant, we gather in at length.<br />
Great God of Justice, be Thou just to me,<br />
And as my thoughts, so let my future be.</p>

LONDON &lsquo;BOBBY&rsquo;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TRIBUTE TO THE</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND&rsquo;S
CAPITAL</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">Here in my cosy corner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before a blazing log,<br />
I&rsquo;m thinking of cold London<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapped in its killing fog;<br />
And, like a shining beacon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the picture grim,<br />
I see the London &lsquo;Bobby,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sing my song for him.</p>
<p class="poetry">I see his stalwart figure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see his kindly face,<br />
I hear his helpful answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At any hour or place.<br />
For, though you seek some by-way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long miles from his own beat,<br />
He tells you all about it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how to find the street.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; This king of earth&rsquo;s police&mdash;<br />
Yet in his voice lies feeling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his eye lies peace;<br />
He knows and does his duty&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (What higher praise is there?)<br />
And London&rsquo;s lords and paupers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike receive his care.</p>
<p class="poetry">He has a regal bearing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet one that breathes repose;<br />
It is the look and manner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of one who <i>thinks</i> and <i>knows</i>.<br />
Oh, men who govern nations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In old worlds or in new,<br />
Turn to the London &lsquo;Bobby&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And learn a thing or two.</p>

THE BENEFIT<br />
OF CLARA MORRIS</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">(AMERICA&rsquo;S GREAT EMOTIONAL
ACTRESS)</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The Radiant Rulers of Mystic Regions<br />
Where souls of artists are fitted for birth<br />
Gathered together their lovely legions<br />
And fashioned a woman to shine on earth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They bathed her in splendour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They made her tender,<br />
They gave her a nature both sweet and wild;<br />
They gave her emotions like storm-stirred oceans,<br />
And they gave her the heart of a little child.</p>
<p class="poetry">These Radiant Rulers (who are not human<br />
Nor yet divine like the gods above)<br />
Poured all their gifts in the soul of woman,<br />
That fragile vessel meant only for love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still more they taught her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still more they brought her,<br />
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Till they
gave her the world for a harp one day:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they bade her string it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They bade her ring it,<br />
While the stars all wondered to hear her play.</p>
<p class="poetry">She touched the strings in a master fashion,<br
/>
She uttered the cry of a world&rsquo;s despair:<br />
Its long hid secret, its pent-up passion,<br />
She gave to the winds in a vibrant air.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For oh! the heart of her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the art of her.<br />
Great with the feeling that makes men kin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Art unapproachable,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Art all uncoachable,<br />
Fragrance and flame from the spirit within.</p>
<p class="poetry">The earth turns ever an ear unheeding<br />
To the sorrows of art, as it cries &lsquo;encore.&rsquo;<br />
And she played on the harp till her hands were bleeding,<br />
And her brow was bruised by the laurels she wore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew the trend of it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew the end of it&mdash;<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Men heard
the music and men felt the thrill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bound to the altar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of art, could she falter?<br />
Then came a silence&mdash;the music was still.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet in the echoes we seem to hear it;<br />
In waves unbroken it circles the earth:<br />
And we catch in the light of her dauntless spirit<br />
A gleam from the centre that gave her birth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still is the fame of her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Felt in the name of her&mdash;<br />
But low lies the harp that once thrilled to her strain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No hand has taken it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No hand can waken it&mdash;<br />
For the soul of her art was her secret of pain.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>TWO
GHOSTS</h2>
<p class="poetry">Two dead men boarded a spectral ship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the astral Port of Space;<br />
On that ghost-filled barque, they met in the dark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And halted, face to face.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Now whither away&rsquo;&mdash;called one
of the ghosts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;This ship sets sail for Earth.<br />
On the astral plane you must remain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the newly dead have birth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But I could not stay and I would not
stay,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other ghost replied;<br />
&lsquo;I must hurry back to the old Earth track<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stand at my loved one&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;She weeps for me in her lonely room,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the land from whence I came;<br />
Oh! stow me away in this ship, I pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I hear her call my name.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Delicate creature of light and shade,<br />

She grasped the scope of the First Intent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made her kingdom <i>for her</i>, no other,<br

And never in camp, or in cave, or in home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose voice of mother or mate complaining.<br />
And never the foot of her sought to roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till love in the heart of the man seemed waning.</p>

<p class="poetry">I am thinking of the Springtime<br />
On the farm out in the West,<br />
When my world held nothing for me that I wanted,<br />
(Save a courage all undaunted),<br />
And my foolish little rhymes,<br />
Were but heart beats, rung in chimes,<br />
That I sounded, just to ease my life&rsquo;s unrest.<br />
Yes, I sang them, and I rang them,<br />
Just to ease my youth&rsquo;s unrest.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I heard the name of London,<br />
In that early day, afar,<br />
In that Springtime of my Country over yonder,<br />
Then I used to sit and wonder<br />

When my ship should cross the sea,<br />
To the land that seemed as distant as a star.<br />

I am sitting here, your guest.<br />
Nay&mdash;I think it is a vision, or a fancy&mdash;<br />
Part of dreamland Necromancy;<br />
And I question: is it true<br />
That the great warm hearts of you,<br />
Heard the winging of that singing in the West,<br />
Heard the chiming of my rhyming<br />
From the farmhouse in the West?</p>
<p class="poetry">Let me linger in the fancy,<br />
For the soul of me is stirred<br />
As I dream that I am sitting here among you;<br />
And the songs that I have sung you<br />
Shall grow stronger through the art<br />
Of heart speaking unto heart,<br />
Through the gladness of the singer who is heard<br />
Lo! my songs have crossed the ocean<br />
But the voice of my emotion finds no word.</p>

MOORISH MAID</h2>
<p class="poetry">Above her veil a shrouded Moorish maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Showed melting eyes, as limpid as a lake;<br />
A brow untouched by care; a band of jetty hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing more.&nbsp; The all-concealing haik<br

Fell to her high arched instep.&nbsp; At her side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An old duenna walked; her withered face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half covered only, since no lingering grace<br />
Bespoke the beauty once her master&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p class="poetry">Above her veil, the Moorish maid beheld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The modern world, in Paris-decked Algiers;<br />
Saw happy lad and lass, in love&rsquo;s contentment pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or in sweet wholesome friendship, free from
fears.<br />
She saw fair matrons, walking arm-in-arm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With life-long lovers, time-endeared, and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw the ardent look in eyes of men,<br />
And thrilled and trembled with a vague alarm.</p>

Some day, full soon, she would go forth a bride&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of one whose face she never had beheld.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Something within her, wakened, and rebelled;<br />
She flung aside her veil, and cried, and cried.</p>

<p class="poetry">The tear comes quicker, the laugh comes
slower;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The courage is lesser to do and dare;<br />
And the tide of joy in the heart falls lower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seldom covers the reefs of care.</p>
<p class="poetry">But all true things in the world seem truer;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the better things of earth seem best,<br />
And friends are dearer, as friends are fewer,<br />

Rose cross on cross; and nailed upon each one<br />
Was my dead self.&nbsp; And yet that gruesome sight<br />
Lent sudden splendour to the falling night,<br />
Showing the conquests that my soul had won.</p>

&lsquo;There is no death! for year on year, re-born<br />

Veiled from her lashes to her feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She stepped from her abode,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The cry of the wordless weak.<br />
From street, from cage, and from kennel,<br />

Of my tortured kin proclaims the sin<br />

Grim Death, to steal my treasures.&nbsp; Death replied:<br />

To do the will of Christ, our Lord and Master, day by day;<br />
And with this prayer upon my lips, I knew not that I dreamed,<br

But suddenly the world of night a pandemonium seemed.<br />
From forest, and from slaughter house, from bull ring, and from
stall,<br />
There rose an anguished cry of pain, a loud, appealing call;<br

As man&mdash;the dumb beast&rsquo;s next of kin&mdash;with gun,
and whip, and knife,<br />
Went pleasure-seeking through the earth, blood-bent on taking
life.<br />
From trap, and cage, and house, and zoo, and street, that awful

through the noise,<br />
Like phantoms in an underworld, were little girls and boys.<br />
Their backs were bent, their brows were pale, their eyes were sad
and old;<br />
But by the labour of their hands greed added gold to gold.<br />
Again the Presence and the Voice: &lsquo;Behold the crimes I
see,<br />
As ye have done it unto these, so have ye done to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Again I slept.&nbsp; I seemed to climb a hard,

beside me, stood upright&mdash;and then I turned in wrath.<br />
&lsquo;Go back!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What right have you
to walk beside me here?<br />
For you are black, and I am white.&rsquo;&nbsp; I paused, struck
dumb with fear.<br />
For lo! the black man was not there, but Christ stood in his
place;<br />
And oh! the pain, the pain, the pain that looked from that dear
face.</p>

sweet, rhythmic din<br />
Which tells the world that Christ has come to save mankind from
sin.<br />
And through the open door of church and temple passed a
throng,<br />
To worship Him with bended knee, with sermon, and with song.<br

But over all I heard the cry of hunted, mangled things;<br />
Those creatures which are part of God, though they have hoofs and
wings.<br />

71</span>FICTION AND FACT</h2>
<p class="poetry">In books I read, how men have lived and
died,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hopeless love deep in their bosoms hidden.<br
/>
While she for whom they long in secret sighed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went on her way, nor guessed this flame
unbidden.</p>
<p class="poetry">In real life, I never chanced to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who was loved, and did not know it,<br />
And observation proves this fact to me:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No man can love a woman and not show it.</p>

<p class="poetry">There is no progress in the world of bees,<br

However wise and wonderful they are.<br />
Their wisdom makes not increase.&nbsp; Lies the bar,<br />
To wider goals, in that tense strife to please<br />
A Sovereign Ruler?&nbsp; Forth from flowers to trees<br />
Their little quest is; not from star to star.<br />
This is not growth; the mighty avatar<br />
Comes not to do his work with such as these.</p>
<p class="poetry">So in the world of men; when legions toil<br />
To feed a Monarch, and begem a crown,<br />
They build before high heaven a narrowing wall<br />
And the great purpose of Creation spoil.<br />
Not on, and upward, is the trend, but down;<br />
The Race can rise but with the rise of all.</p>

THE WHITE ROSE CAME</h2>
<p class="poetry">The roses all were pink and red,<br />
Before the Bumble Bee,<br />
A lover bold, with cloak of gold,<br />
Came singing merrily<br />
Along the sunlit ways that led<br />
From woodland, and from lea.</p>
<p class="poetry">He paused beside an opening rose,<br />
The garden&rsquo;s pet and pride;<br />
She burst in flower that very hour,<br />
While wooing zephyrs sighed;<br />
No smile had she for one of those,<br />
And hope within them died.</p>
<p class="poetry">The ardent butterfly in vain<br />
On radiant wings drew near;<br />
The hapless moth in vain grew wroth&mdash;<br />
The fair rose leaned to hear<br />
The deep-voiced stranger&rsquo;s low refrain<br />
That thrilled upon her ear.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And let the whole world see;<br />
Alas! one day, away, away,<br />
Sped truant Bumble Bee;<br />
&rsquo;Twas then the red rose turned to white&mdash;<br />
So was the tale told me.</p>

Who from the year&rsquo;s beginning to its close<br />
Dwell, where unfading verdure tireless grows,<br />
And where sweet summer&rsquo;s harp is kept in tune.<br />
We must have listened to the winter&rsquo;s rune,<br />
And felt impatient longings for the rose,<br />
Ere its full radiance on our vision glows,<br />
Or with its fragrant soul, we can commune.</p>

And in the long, long watches wait for day.<br />

From the winter nun to the bride of May,<br />
And the harp of Spring is attuned to play<br />
The wedding march, and the sun is priest,<br />
And the world is bidden to join the feast.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, never is felt in a tropic clime,<br />
Where the singing of birds is a ceaseless chime,<br />
That leap o&rsquo; the blood, and the rapture thrill,<br />
That comes to us here, with the first bird&rsquo;s trill;<br />
And only the eye that has looked on snows<br />
Can see the beauty that lies in a rose.<br />
The lure of the tropics I understand,<br />
But ho! for the Spring in my native land.</p>

He would not strive for worldly gain, not he.<br />
His wealth, he said, was stored in God&rsquo;s To Be.<br />
He kept his mortal body poorly drest,<br />
And talked about the garments of the blest.<br />
And when to his last sleep he laid him down,<br />
His only mourner begged her widow&rsquo;s gown.</p>
<p class="poetry">One was not sure there was a life to come,<br

So made an Eden of his earthly home.<br />
He strove for wealth, and with an open hand<br />

Helped many a brother to keep out the cold.<br />

festivals, or departing visitors, with long wreaths of natural
flowers, and which are worn by men, as well as women, about the

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
